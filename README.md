My Machine Learning; here are my own projects for ML during my learn time. Some of them are quit interesting from my point of view.

I liked a lot the weather of Berlin dataset, cause it include like 140 years of daily measurement; of course the very old measurements are just temperatures but still i found it quite interesting for practicing Pandas and after using it for regression model.

Another one nice is the yellow taxi data set. Due to memory issues on my laptop I had to turn to a smaller set as for one month, but still it includes millions of rows. So here I learned a bit of Dask to accelerate the work. My task was also a regression model to find out the prices for taxi rides.

I wanted on the beginning after studiying with "Hands on ML" to try myself on a different housing dataset as shown in that book. So I found a german one dataset. It was not really similar, mostly just ads from biggest german apartment search website. Neverthless it was quite interesting task as well.

There are also the classic datasets like:
- cancer dataset
- iris
- mnist
- students
- peoples face detection
