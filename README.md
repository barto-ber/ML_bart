# my MACHINE LEARNING
here are my own Machine Learning projects during my study time. You will find here the classic projects as well as some more interesting.

## Web App for classification of fake and true news.

This is my second end-to-end Machine Learning project using django and deployment on heroku with AWS S3. There is a part of data manipulation, cleaning and exploratory analysis as well. Data is from kaggle.

## Web App for prediction of heart failure.

This is my first end-to-end Machine Learning project using django and deployment on heroku. There is a part of data manipulation, cleaning and exploratory analysis as well. Data is well known from kaggle.

## Prediction of weather in Berlin
I liked a lot the weather of Berlin dataset, cause it include like 144 years of daily measurement; of course the very old measurements are just temperatures but still i found it quite interesting for practicing Pandas and after using it for regression model.

## Prediction cost of taxi drive in NY
Another one nice is the yellow taxi data set. Due to memory issues on my laptop I had to turn to a smaller set as for one month, but still it includes millions of rows. So here I learned a bit of Dask to accelerate the work. My task was also a regression model to find out the prices for taxi rides.

## Classification of fake and true news
Thre is also a project for NPL, which worked quite nice based on fake and true press articles.

## Prediction of rents in Germany
I wanted on the beginning after studiying with "Hands on ML" to try myself on a different housing dataset as shown in that book. So I found a german one dataset. It was not really similar, mostly just ads from biggest german apartment search website. Neverthless it was quite interesting task as well.

During my learning I also worked with the classic datasets (which are not here) like:
- cancer dataset
- iris
- mnist
- students
- peoples face detection
