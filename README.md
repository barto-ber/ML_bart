My Machine Learning

Hier are my own projects for ML during my learn time. Some of them are quit interesting from my point of view.

I liked a lot the weather of Berlin dataset, cause it include like 140 years of daily measurement; of course the very old measurements are just temperatures but still i found it quite interesting for practicing Pandas and after using it for regression model.

Another one nice is the yellow taxi data set. Due to memory issues on my laptop I had to turn to a smaller set as for one month, but still it includes millions of rows. So here I learned a bit of Dask to accelerate the work. My task was also a regression model to find out the prices for taxi rides.
